# Taming the Operational Complexities of Platform Engineering Environment
Following are the various aspects of taming the **Operational Complexities** of Platform Engineering environment:
- **Monitoring**
  - Infrastructure health monitoring
  - Service health monitoring: traffic, errors, latency
  - Business metrics monitoring
- **Oncall, Anomaly Detection, and Escalations/Alerting**
  - Detecting anomalies from the monitoring data is a tough challenge
- **Outages & Incident Management Processes**
  - Communicating outages across the organization
  - Mitigation now, investigation tomorrow/later
- **Postmortems, Incident Reviews & a Culture of Ongoing Improvements**
  - Contributors
  - Incident Summary
  - Impact
  - Timeline
  - Root Cause Analysis
  - Detection Mitigation & Prevention Analysis
  - Lessons Learnt
  - Follow-up Actions
- **ChaosMonkey like Failover Drills, Planned Downtime & Capacity Planning & Blackbox Testing**
  - A data center failover drill
  - Planned service downtime exercises
  - Black-box testing
  - Capacity Planning
  - Reliability as an Ongoing Investment
- **SLOs, SLAs & Reporting on them**
  - Business-level SLOs or functional SLOs
  - SLA - Service Level Agreement - is a broader agreement between a service provider and a service consumer. Usually, multiple SLOs make up an SLA. For example, the payments system being 99.99% available could be an SLA, that breaks down to specific SLOs for each supporting system.
