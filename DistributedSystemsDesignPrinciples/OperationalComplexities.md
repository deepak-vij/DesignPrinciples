# Taming the Operational Complexities of Platform Engineering Environment
Following are the various aspects of taming the **Operational Complexities** of Platform Engineering environment:
- **Logging**: Logging has to be ubiquitously integrated pervasively into the source code. 
- **Monitoring**: Logging is quite useful if the application is actually running. It is no good if the application itself is dead. There has to be some entity outside the application process that must be watching - this is the domain of monitoring systems. 
  - Infrastructure health monitoring
  - Service health monitoring: traffic, errors, latency
  - Business metrics monitoring
- **Oncall, Anomaly Detection, and Escalations/Alerting**:
  - Detecting anomalies from the monitoring data is a tough challenge
- **Outages & Incident Management Processes**:
  - Communicating outages across the organization
  - Mitigation now, investigation tomorrow/later
- **Postmortems, Incident Reviews & a Culture of Ongoing Improvements**:
  - Contributors
  - Incident Summary
  - Impact
  - Timeline
  - Root Cause Analysis
  - Detection Mitigation & Prevention Analysis
  - Lessons Learnt
  - Follow-up Actions
- **Releases Shouldn't Hurt**:
  - Zero Downtime Deployments
- **ChaosMonkey like Failover Drills, Planned Downtime & Capacity Planning & Blackbox Testing**:
  - A data center failover drill
  - Planned service downtime exercises
  - Black-box testing
  - Capacity Planning
  - Reliability as an Ongoing Investment
- **SLOs, SLAs & Reporting on them**:
  - Business-level SLOs or functional SLOs
  - SLA - Service Level Agreement - is a broader agreement between a service provider and a service consumer. Usually, multiple SLOs make up an SLA. For example, the payments system being 99.99% available could be an SLA, that breaks down to specific SLOs for each supporting system.
