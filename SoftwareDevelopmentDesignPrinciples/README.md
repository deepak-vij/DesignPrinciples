# Software Development Design Principles & Patterns
Design Patterns provide a common language and framework to the task of programming. Design patterns are well tested solutions to several programming problems. The whole idea is that someone else has already faced the problem one typically faces while doing programming and has come up with an optimal solution that implements all kinds of good design. These patterns are typically interface-based patterns which could be reused in a variety of contexts. Usage of these patterns results into code reliability, modularity, agility and extensibility via decoupling etc. The following is list of patterns and principles which I have subscribed to all these years I have been involved in software development initiatives (poducts & projects). 
- [Towards Modern Development of Cloud Applications – beyond “Microservices”](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/BeyondMicroServices/README.md)
- [Open-Closed Design Principle enabled using Interfaces/Polymorphism](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/OCP/README.md)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/DepInv/README.md)
- There are several other well known categories of programming design patterns, these are all highly recommended as part of any large scale software development process. The following is a list of few notable & well proven patterns:
  - Structural Patterns
    - [Facade Pattern](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/Facade/README.md)
    - [Composite Pattern](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/Composite/README.md)
    - [Adapter Pattern](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/Adapter/README.md)
    - [Proxy Pattern](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/Proxy/README.md)
    - ...
  - Creational Patterns
    - [Singleton Pattern](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/Singleton/README.md)
    - [Abstract Factory Pattern](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/AbstractFactory/README.md)
    - ...
  - Behavioral Patterns
    - [Chain of Responsibility](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/ChainofResponsibility/README.md)
    - [Strategy Pattern](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/Strategy/README.md)
    - Observer Pattern
