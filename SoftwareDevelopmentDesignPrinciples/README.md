# Software Development Design Principles
Design Patterns provide a common language and framework to the task of programming. Design patterns are well tested solutions to several programming problems. The whole idea is that someone else has already faced the problem one typically faces while doing programming and has come up with an optimal solution that implements all kinds of good design. These patterns are typically interface-based patterns which could be reused in a variety of contexts. Usage of these patterns results into code reliability, modularity, agility and extensibility via decoupling etc. The following is list of patterns and principles which I have subscribed to all these years I have been involved in software development initiatives (poducts & projects). 
- [Towards Modern Development of Cloud Applications – beyond “Microservices”](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/BeyondMicroServices/README.md)
- [Open-Closed Design Principle enabled using Interfaces/Polymorphism](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/OCP/README.md)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/DepInv/README.md)
- There are several other well known categories of programming design patterns which are highly recommended as part of any large scale software development process. Please see [DESIGN PATTERNS in GO](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/go) for description and code samples for these well proven design patterns:
  - Creational Patterns
    - [Abstract Factory Pattern](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/AbstractFactory/README.md)
    - [Singleton Pattern](/SoftwareDevelopmentDesignPrinciples/Singleton/README.md)

  - Structural Patterns

  - Behavioral Patterns
